# we need to import some lib like requests for https requests ans beautifulsoup
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# now url for the site that you want to scrap
url = "https://amazon.com"

# after that you have to give https requests using get method
r = requests.get(url)

#getting html content 
htmlContent = r.content

# we are printing that htmlContent using print statement
#print(htmlContent)  -----> you can remove this comment for the output


# now we have parsed that html content to beautifulsoup 
soup = BeautifulSoup(htmlContent, 'html.parser')

# you can print that soup variable to see the output 
#print(soup)

# printing title 
title = soup.title 
print(title)  # this print statement give you output as a tag so if you want output as a simple text you need to use one method get_text()


print(title.get_text())
